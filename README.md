# Comparison-Between-NWALBP-and-CS-NWALBP

This paper is based on the implementation of
facial recognition by using the feature extraction process CS-
NWALBP(Center symmetric neighborhood weighted average
local binary pattern). To further improve the performance of
the existing local binary pattern (LBP) operator which is the
first operator used to solve the complex illumination problem
with facial recognition, neighborhood weighted average LBP
(NWALBP) is first proposed for fully considering the strong cor-
relations between pixel pairs in the neighborhood, which extends
the traditional LBP uni-layer neighborhood template window
to the bi-layer neighborhood template window and calculates
the weighted average of bi-layer neighborhood pixels in each
direction. Then, inspired by center symmetric LBP (CS-LBP),
center symmetric NWALBP (CS-NWALBP) is further proposed,
which can effectively reduce computation complexity by only
comparing the weighted average values of the neighborhood
pixels that are symmetric about the center pixe
